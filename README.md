Title: react_numbers March 2019 By: Shenikia Thomas

What It Is: react_numbers is a project created while in Code Louisville that has been a fun attempt at web development. react_numbers is a single page application that I built to be fun.

There is a short survey on the Marvel link as well as the Marvel information generated from the users birthday.  Character has very basic 'astrology' information .
